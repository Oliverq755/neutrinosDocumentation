## Guide
### Overview
A line chart is a chart which is used to display the data points in connected straight line segments. In the chart, the point is plotted in a way that the point has appeared.
#### Use Case
Let us consider a scenario of Insurance Company, where a company wants to track the overall performance of the year with insured client and month. The company chart needs to show the performance of the individual months with the number of clients that are insured. The company KPI (Key Performance Indicator) should be able to see the previous data as well as the current data along with the graph indicating the rise or fall of the insured client. In this use case, line chart will successfully provide all of these features.
Some of the other popular use cases of line chart are:
- Banking
- Health center
- Retails
- Education
- Product Analysis in Industries
- Climate Change Statistic 
#### Usages
The line chart is popularly used in chart of the trending data. For an instance, stock market share chart
##### Prerequisites
1. New page.
2. Default route for the newly created page.
##### How to use?
1. Open the newly created page.
2. Drag and drop the line chart from Ng Charts category.
3. Switch to Ts file of the page and then declare the variable and provide values for the following in the component class :- 
    * A dataset array (contains y-axis values and labels of the legend). For example,
        ```typescript 
        public lineChartData:Array<any> = [
        {data: [65, 59, 55, 81, 56, 55, 40], label: 'Series A'},
        {data: [28, 48, 40, 19, 86, 27, 90], label: 'Series B'}
         ];
        ```
    * A labels array (contains x-axis values). For example,
        ```typescript
        public lineChartLabels:Array<any> = ['January', 'February', 'March','April', 'May', 'June', 'July'];
        ```
    * Legend value (either true or false). For example, 
        ```typescript
        public legend=false;
        ```
    * Options value. For example,
        ```typescript
        public lineChartOptions:any = {
        responsive: true
        };
        ```
4. Now switch back to Html file of the page and 
5. Provide the dataset array name in the [datasets] attribute. For example,
        ```
		[datasets] = lineChartData
		```
6. Provide the labels name in [labels] attribute. For example,
        ```
        [labels] = lineChartLabels
        ```
7. Provide the options name in [options] attribute. For example,
        ```
        [legend] = legend
        ```
8. Provide the legend name in [legend] attributes. For example,
        ```
		[options] = lineChartOptions
		```
9. Save the page and run the application 
##### Example
Let's take an example of Insurance company. The KPI (Key Performance Indicator) team want to check the status of the company performance of a particular year 2017.

```
###### Legend
